# Homomorphic Encryption

Homomorphic Encryption allows to perform calculations on encrypted data.

I put together a [collection of links](he.md) on Homomorphic Encryption - with a big thanks to the [FHE.org community][FHEorg].

I wrote some instructions how to compile and run selected libraries. Status: Feb 2022. 

* [HElib](helib.md)
* [SEAL](seal.md)

Note that the [FHE toolkit](fhetoolkit.md) (containerized version of HElib) doesn't compile anymore in Feb 2022. Looks like the project has been abandonded.
