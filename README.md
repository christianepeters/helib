# Homomorphic Encryption

Homomorphic Encryption allows to perform calculations on encrypted data without decrypting it first ([Wikipedia][Wiki]).

See [here](he.md) for a collection of links on Homomorphic Encryption (with thanks to the [FHE.org community][FHEorg]).

I wrote some instructions how to compile and run selected libraries. Status: mid 2021. Some may need an update. 

* [HElib](helib.md),
* [SEAL](seal.md), and
* the [FHE toolkit](fhetoolkit.md) which is a containerized version of HElib coming with its own IDE.
