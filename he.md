# Homomorphic Encryption

## About

Homomorphic Encryption allows to perform calculations on encrypted data without decrypting it first.

## Homomorphic Encryption

### Example HE cryptosystems

* RSA cryptosystem (unbounded number of modular multiplications)
* ElGamal cryptosystem (unbounded number of modular multiplications)
* Goldwasserâ€“Micali cryptosystem (unbounded number of exclusive or operations)
* Benaloh cryptosystem (unbounded number of modular additions)
* Paillier cryptosystem (unbounded number of modular additions)

### FHE more practical

* Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV, 2011) scheme, building on techniques of Brakerski-Vaikuntanathan
```
=> good for masking and integer arithmetic
```
* The NTRU-based scheme by Lopez-Alt, Tromer, and Vaikuntanathan (LTV, 2012)
* Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV, 2012) scheme, building on Brakerski's scale-invariant cryptosystem
* NTRU-based scheme by Bos, Lauter, Loftus, and Naehrig (BLLN, 2013), building on LTV and Brakerski's scale-invariant cryptosystem
* Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS, 2016) scheme.
  * Note that there were some issues with CCKS reported recently by Li and Micciancio ([eprint report][EP201533]). In response, the HElib team published a [list of mitigations][CCKS-mitigations].
```
=> floating point arithmetic => machine learning
```

## First steps to make FHE practical
In 2020, IBM Research conducted a project with a Brazilian Bank to implement a pilot using Homomorphic Encryption (HE) to a machine learning (ML) pipeline. Specifically they used HE in the ML to two of the important ML tasks, namely the variable selection phase of the model generation task and the prediction task.
